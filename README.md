A basic machine learning algorithm, named Dendrite Net or DD, just like SVM or MLP. 


DD is a new basic algorithm.
If you find an algorithm similar to DD, please contact me.  You may have misunderstood.
Based on previous experience, new things are easy to be questioned. 
I will explain to you, and I believe you will agree with me.

Good DD are eager to be asked. I like the discussions very much.

Use it and you will find it is great.

Contact me if you have problems in use.
