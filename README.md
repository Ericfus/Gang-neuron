Dendrite Net: A White-Box Module for Classification, Regression, and System Identification: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03955.   It may be time to improve the neuron of artificial neural network (blogs-IEEE preprints-You should cite it.): https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.12477266


A basic machine learning algorithm, named Dendrite Net or DD, just like SVM or MLP. 


DD is a brand new basic algorithm.
If you find an algorithm similar to DD, please contact me.  You may have misunderstood.
Based on previous experience, new things are easy to be questioned. 
I will explain to you, and I believe you will agree with me.

Good DD are eager to be asked. I like the discussions very much.

Use it and you will find it is great.
